# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lance Avitia

I dove into web development at the beggining of 2020 and been neck deep ever since.

I'm more than skilled with the basics:
- css (Bootsrap, Tailwind, but im partial to Sass),
- HTML (EJS, JSX, PUG), and 
- Javascript (React, Next.js and the more niche Svelte / SvelteKit)

I'm always looking for the next project to challenge me to learn one more thing.
