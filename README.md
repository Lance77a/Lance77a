- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lance Avitia
I dove into web development at the beggining of 2020 and been neck deep ever since.
- I'm very comfortable with the basics:
css (Bootsrap, Tailwind, prefer SASS when given the choice)
HTML (EJS, JSX, PUG)
Vanilla JS (as well as popular frameworks such as React-Next.js and the more niche Svelte-Sapper)
And I'm constantly growing more proficient as time goes on.
- I'm always looking for work through my freelance company, Monocled Design. monocleddesign@gmail.com
